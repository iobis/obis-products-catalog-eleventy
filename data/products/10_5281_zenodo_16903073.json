  "description": "<p>This figure illustrates the global distribution of Monoplex nicobaricus (R&ouml;ding, 1798), based on 4,245 georeferenced occurrence records compiled from GBIF, OBIS an iNaturalist. The species exhibits a broad Indo-Pacific distribution extending into the tropical Atlantic, with verified records from the Canary Islands. Occurrence data were standardized, quality-checked, and integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework, with spatial analyses and map production produced in Mapbox Studio. The figure&nbsp;forms part of the manuscript &ldquo;Monoplex nicobaricus (R&ouml;ding, 1798) in the Canary Islands: A Comprehensive Study of Morphology,&nbsp;Ecology, and Behavior&rdquo; and is presented here as a stand-alone supplementary reference.</p>",
