  "description": "<p>The DASCO workflow has been designed to integrate regional checklists of alien species occurrences and occurrence records provided by GBIF and OBIS to identify coordinate-based occurrences of alien populations. It can therefore be used to downscale information available in regional checklists and to re-allocate species occurrences to any spatial categorisation, which is provided by the user.</p>\n<p>The DASCO workflow is written in R and open access. The workflow is described together with a global case study&nbsp; in a peer-reviewed publication (see below) together with a manual.</p>\n<p>When using any components of the workflow, please cite the following publication:</p>\n<p>Seebens H, Kaplan E (2022) DASCO: A workflow to downscale alien species checklists using occurrence records and to re-allocate species distributions across realms.
